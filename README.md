## About Me
My name is **EL MOUTARIF Badreddine**. I spent **three years** **studying mathematics and its applications** at university. During that time, I also delved into programming subjects, which ignited my passion for learning how to code. I've explored algorithms and am currently diving into the world of *ALX-SE*.

In this era of rapid artificial intelligence development, my curiosity has grown, leading me to enroll in one of the most fascinating courses worldwide: *AICE*.
